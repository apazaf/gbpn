Dear Snowball Lovers,  
the most distinguished representatives of APAZAF conducted an inspection of the playing field today, finding it in decidedly mediocre conditions: there is little snow, and the snow present is a bit dry and icy.
However, it is possible to dig a little and collect the snow to make snowballs, so the Battle will take place anyway!

Here's the status of the snow cover at the Bivouac:  
![Snow status at the Bivouac](/media/post/2025-snow-status.jpg)

In the worst case, instead of a Great Snowball Fight, we will take a Gorgeous Walk to the Menegazzi Bivouac, which is always a great idea.

The way up on foot is comfortable, with some ice but not too annoying.
It is impossible to use a bobsleigh, skis or similar items.

The meeting place for departure is, as indicated in the [details page](details/), the **parking lot in front of the church of Mas (Sedico)** ([46.1549N, 12.1284E](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nMUASUtqYFCnvLbbA)), at 8:00 AM.
From there we will form cars to reach the start of the walk.

Please, be punctual!
