Dear Snowballers,  
it is with heavy hearts and frostbitten souls that we must announce some devastating news:
Due to personal matters, we regretfully must announce that **the 2026 Great Snowball Fight is CANCELLED**.
💔❄️

This decision has not been made lightly. We know how much this event means to all of you brave snow soldiers who have been sharpening your throwing arms and perfecting your fort-building techniques.
We share your disappointment deeply, but fear not, fellow fighters!
The Great Snowball Fight WILL return in 2027, and it will be worth the wait!

Stay frosty, stay patient, and stay awesome.

Regretfully but resolutely yours,
The APAZAF Team ⛄💙
