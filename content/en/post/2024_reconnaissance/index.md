Dear snowballers,  
today rapresentatives from APAZAF went to the battlefield to check the snow conditions and the Bivouac.  
We are happy to report that there are 20-40cm of snow. It's a bit powdery (not great for snowballs), but it's enough to have a good fight!

As always, the Bivouac is in great shape and the battlefield looks awesome!

Below you can find a detailed analysis of the snow status performed by our resident snow expert:

We are looking forward to seeing you all at the [meeting point in Belluno](https://goo.gl/maps/NCjzBdygPNi8cSFFA) on the morning of the 3rd of January, 2024, at 07:30!

Of course, you are also welcome to get directly to the [parking area](https://goo.gl/maps/ip4GK8xxJjwSsrPr5) from which the trek starts, at around 08:40.

See you soon!
