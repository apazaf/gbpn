Dear friends of snowballs,  
the 2025 Battle is no more!

We didn't get the snow we hoped for, but we had fun nonetheless:
some with a daring walk, others experimenting with the silliest ways to slide on the icy snow.

Above all, we joyfully shared the legendary APAZAF meal, which was devoured with great satisfaction by all participants.

A big thank you to all the participants: as always, you made a wonderful day even more memorable!  
APAZAF warmly thanks you for your participation and support: it means a lot to us.

APAZAF cannot thank you enough for your participation and your support, it means the world to us!

[Here](/galleries/2025) you can find some photos of this edition; if you have some to share, don't hesitate to [contact us](/contact)!

## Report, suggestions and feedback

This year we received 55€ in donations, which cover for the food: thanks!

Even more precious is feedback.
Do you have any constructive criticism, or ideas to make the Battle better?  
If so, please [share them with APAZAF](/contact), you will be rewarded with our endless gratitude.
It really is very important for us, so don't be shy!

## That's all, folks! See you at the 2026 Battle!
