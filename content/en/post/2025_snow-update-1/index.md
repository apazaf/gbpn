Dear Snowballers,  
the current snow situation is not great: there are patches of snow around, maybe even enough to throw some snowballs, but it is melting fast due to the high temperatures.
We are however hopeful that it'll snow a bit between the 2nd and the 3rd of January, or so the weather models seem to [suggest](https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/week/gosaldo_italy_3175974).

In terms of participants, we are happy to announce that we have already 20 people [registered](/register) for the event!

For those who are already planning to come, we suggest you keep an eye on the weather forecast and on the [snow status page](/snow) on our site, where we'll post updates as soon as we have them.
We'll probably cancel the event if there is no snow, but we'll make a final decision on the 2nd or 3rd of January.

We'll hopefully see you all soon,
The APAZAF Team
