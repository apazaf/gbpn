Dear Snowballers,  
the Battle is CONFIRMED!  
The weather forecast promises *some* snow between the 2nd and the 3rd of January, and we have hopes that it will be enough to have a good snowball fight.

In the morning on the 3rd of January APAZAF will reconnoiter the battlefield and report back to you with the final decision:
we have decided that in the worst case scenario (if it has not snowed at all) we'll still go forward with the event,
and just have a nice trek with lunch at the Menegazzi bivouac.

Happy new year and see you soon!
