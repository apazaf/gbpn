Dear snowballers,
the GBPN 2024 was a great success!

Around 20 heroic fighters (give or take - who can count that much?) battled proudly and sportingly at the Menegazzi Bivouac,
and both the pink and yellow teams brought home their share of glory and wet socks.

A great way to start the new year!

It was a glorious day:
the snow was good, the beans delicious, the sky as blue as it gets and the company, as always, dazzling, amiable, charming, legendary, agreeable, benevolent, delightful and, most importantly, unfinkling (not forward nor backwards!).

APAZAF cannot thank you enough for your participation and your support, it means the world to us!

[Here](/galleries/2024) you can find some photos of this edition; if you have some to share, don't hesitate to [contact us](/contact)!
