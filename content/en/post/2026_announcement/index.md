Dear Snowball Warriors,

Brace yourselves, winter is coming... again! ❄️🎯 The snow gods have spoken, and we, the mighty APAZAF, are absolutely THRILLED to announce that the most anticipated frozen festivities of the year are back!

Mark your calendars with icicles, set reminders with snowflakes, and prepare your battle stations because the **2026 Great Snowball Fight** will take place on **Saturday, 3 January 2026**! That's right, we're kicking off the new year with our legendary arctic warfare!

It's been another year of waiting, training, and perfecting our snowball-throwing techniques. Some of you have been practicing with oranges, others with stress balls, and the truly dedicated have been visiting freezers just to get that authentic snow feel. Well, the time has come to put all that practice to the test! 🥶

Stay tuned for all the frosty updates by following our [news](/post) section or joining our [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/UsNhFbmVl6W_Odyz). Trust us, you don't want to miss a single snowflake of intel about rules, registration, and secret battle strategies!

In the meantime, start your winter training regimen:

- Practice your throws with any spherical object
- Build up your snow fort engineering skills  
- Stock up on hot chocolate for post-battle celebrations
- Most importantly, pray to the snow gods for perfect packing snow! 🙏

Remember: no yellow snow, no ice chunks, and definitely no rocks disguised as snowballs. We're warriors, not barbarians!

Let the epic countdown to frozen glory begin!

Snow-fully yours,
The APAZAF Team ⛄
